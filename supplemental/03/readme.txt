Great! Here's your level 3 exercise:

Exercise:
You are tasked with creating a simple JavaScript function that will change the color of a paragraph 
when a button is clicked. When the button is clicked for the first time, the paragraph's color 
should change to red. Clicking the button again should change the color back to its original 
state (black). The color should toggle between red and black with each button click.

You should write the necessary HTML and JavaScript code to accomplish this task.

Let me know when you're ready with your solution or if you need any hints!
