# Second Exercise
Great! Here's your level 2 problem:

You have a form on your webpage with two input fields: a text input for the user's name and a submit button. Your task is to write a JavaScript function that is triggered when the submit button is clicked. The function should retrieve the value entered in the name input field and display an alert with a personalized greeting, such as "Hello, [name]!".

Here's the HTML code for the form:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Form Example</title>
  <script src="script.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <form>
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</body>
</html>
Your task is to write the JavaScript code in a separate file called script.js (make sure it's in the same directory as the HTML file). The JavaScript code should listen for the form submission event, retrieve the entered name, and display the personalized greeting using an alert.
