# My Prompt to GPT

i'm learning web development (html and how it interacts with js). i'm getting the idea that I can use html class and id tags to do some clever stuff, but I'd like a little more practice.

I would like you to give me some exercises, the first one should introduce me to these concepts, and they should gradually increase in difficulty based on how I rate the exercise (1 is too easy, 5 is too hard, ideally you'll ask me level 3 or level 4 problems)

# 1st exercise
Exercise:
Create an HTML page that displays a simple to-do list. The list should contain three tasks: "Buy groceries," "Do laundry," and "Go for a run." Each task should be displayed as a separate list item (<li> element). Apply the following styles using classes and ids:

Add a class to the <ul> element called "todo-list".
Apply a different class to each list item (<li>) element. You can name the classes anything you like.
Add an id to the second list item (<li>) element and name it "important-task".
Your task is to create the HTML structure and apply the appropriate classes and id. Feel free to style the list using CSS if you'd like, but that's optional for this exercise.

Once you've completed the exercise, let me know, and I'll provide feedback and move on to the next exercise based on your rating.
