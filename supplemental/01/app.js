// Exercise:
// Create an HTML page that displays a simple to-do list. The list should contain three tasks: 
// "Buy groceries," "Do laundry," and "Go for a run." Each task should be displayed as a separate list item (<li> element). 
// Apply the following styles using classes and ids:

// Add a class to the <ul> element called "todo-list".
// Apply a different class to each list item (<li>) element. You can name the classes anything you like.
// Add an id to the second list item (<li>) element and name it "important-task".
// Your task is to create the HTML structure and apply the appropriate classes and id. Feel free to style the list using CSS 
// if you'd like, but that's optional for this exercise.

// Once you've completed the exercise, let me know, and I'll provide feedback and move on to the next exercise based on your 
// rating.
